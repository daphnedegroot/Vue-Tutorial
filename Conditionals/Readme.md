## Using Conditionals and Rendering Lists
Welcome to another course module. 

Now that we had a detailed look at the general dom interaction with vuejs, how to connect it to the dom, how to work with the template, how to listen to events and so on,it's now time to dive into a little bit more advanced concepts with conditionals and lists, which means what if you only wanted to show a certain part of your page under certain circumstances.

Well for that, we got some tools in the pocket which make that very easy and if you want to output let's say an array of data in a list or something like that, vue.js got a tool for that too. So let's dive into this and learn how we can work with conditionals and lists.


## Result
Your code should now look something like: [this]().
